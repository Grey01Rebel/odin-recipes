This is my first project in Foundations called Recipes

I was able to apply the knowledge I have been assimilating for a few weeks now, though I can't say everything is clear, but I am getting a hang of it. I was able to apply my knowledge of git and Github, how to effectively commit changes, that I am still working on.

Overall I can say that this project is helping me see how much I have learnt about HTML and also an encouragement that it's not a wase of time. I hope to improve on my knowledge of HTML, git , Github, boilerplates, lists, and others.

I'm exited to be on this journey, so this I believe would be a testament that I started small.
