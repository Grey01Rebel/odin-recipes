                <li>½ cup butter</li>
                <li>½ cup fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
                <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
            <ol>
                <p><strong><h3>Step 1</h3></strong></p>
                <li>In a food processor, blend butter, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, and lemon juice together. Pour 1/3 of the blended mixture into a small bowl for marinade. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside.

                </li>
                <p><strong><h3>Step 2</h3></strong></p>
                <li>Lightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Rub chicken breasts with marinade. Place chicken breasts on a platter, cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours.

                </li>
                <p><strong><h3>Step 3</h3></strong></p>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer half of the reserved rosemary and lemon mixture into a bowl for basting. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside for topping cooked chicken.

                </li>
                <p><strong><h3>Step 3</h3></strong></p>
                <li>Cook chicken breasts on hot grill, basting with rosemary and lemon basting mixture, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken breasts from the grill, and top with remaining rosemary and lemon mixture.

                </li>
